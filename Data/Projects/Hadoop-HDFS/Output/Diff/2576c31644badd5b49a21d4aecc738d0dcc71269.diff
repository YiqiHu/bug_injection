 * **Operability**
 
-    * Runtime Configuration - The queue definitions and properties such as capacity, ACLs can be changed, at runtime, by administrators in a secure manner to minimize disruption to users. Also, a console is provided for users and administrators to view current allocation of resources to various queues in the system. Administrators can *add additional queues* at runtime, but queues cannot be *deleted* at runtime unless the queue is STOPPED and nhas no pending/running apps.

     * Drain applications - Administrators can *stop* queues at runtime to ensure that while existing applications run to completion, no new applications can be submitted. If a queue is in `STOPPED` state, new applications cannot be submitted to *itself* or *any of its child queues*. Existing applications continue to completion, thus the queue can be *drained* gracefully. Administrators can also *start* the stopped queues.
