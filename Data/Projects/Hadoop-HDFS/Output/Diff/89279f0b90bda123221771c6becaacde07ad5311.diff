+Enable Router to rename across namespaces. Currently it is implemented based on [HDFS Federation Balance](../../hadoop-federation-balance/HDFSFederationBalance.md) and has some limits comparing with normal rename.
 1. It is much slower than the normal rename so need a longer RPC timeout configuration. See `ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms` and its description for more information about RPC timeout.
 2. It doesn't support snapshot path.
 3. It doesn't support to rename path with multiple destinations.
