 | `yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-applications` / `yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-applications` | Maximum number of applications in the system which can be concurrently active both running and pending. Limits on each queue are directly proportional to their queue capacities and user limits. This is a hard limit and any applications submitted when this limit is reached will be rejected. Default is 10000. This can be set for all queues with `yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-applications` and can also be overridden on a per queue basis by setting `yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-applications`. When this property is not set for a specific queue path, the maximum application number is calculated by taking all configured node labels into consideration, and choosing the highest possible value. Integer value expected. |
 | `yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-am-resource-percent` / `yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-am-resource-percent` | Maximum percent of resources in the cluster which can be used to run application masters - controls number of concurrent active applications. Limits on each queue are directly proportional to their queue capacities and user limits. Specified as a float - ie 0.5 = 50%. Default is 10%. This can be set for all queues with `yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-am-resource-percent` and can also be overridden on a per queue basis by setting `yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-am-resource-percent` |
-| `yarn.scheduler.capacity.max-parallel-apps` / `yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.max-parallel-apps` | Maximum number of applications that can run at the same time. Unlike to `maximum-applications`, application submissions are *not* rejected when this limit is reached. Instead they stay in `ACCEPTED` state until they are eligible to run. This can be set for all queues with `yarn.scheduler.capacity.max-parallel-apps` and can also be overridden on a per queue basis by setting `yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.max-parallel-apps`. Integer value is expected. By default, there is no limit. |

Integer value is expected. By default, there is no limit. The maximum parallel application limit is an inherited property in the queue hierarchy, meaning that the lowest value will be selected as the enforced limit in every branch of the hierarchy. |
 
   You can also limit the number of parallel applications on a per user basis.
