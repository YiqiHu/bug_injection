For authentication to work correctly across all nodes in the cluster the domain must be correctly set. There is no default value, the HTTP cookie will not have a domain working only with the hostname issuing the HTTP cookie.                                                  |

If the value is true, the cookie is a persistent one. Otherwise, it is a session cookie. *IMPORTANT*: when using IP addresses, browsers ignore cookies with domain settings. For this setting to work properly all nodes in the cluster must be configured to generate URLs with `hostname.domain` names on it. |
