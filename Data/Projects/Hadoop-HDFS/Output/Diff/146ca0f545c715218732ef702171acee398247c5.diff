+As an example let's assume you want to run S3Guard integration tests using IDE.
+Please add the following properties in
+`hadoop-tools/hadoop-aws/src/test/resources/auth-keys.xml` file.
+ Local configuration is stored in auth-keys.xml. The changes to this file won't be committed,
+ so it's safe to store local config here.
+```xml
+<property>
+  <name>fs.s3a.s3guard.test.enabled</name>
+  <value>true</value>
+</property>
+```
+
+```xml
+<property>
+  <name>fs.s3a.s3guard.test.implementation</name>
+  <value>dynamo</value>
+</property>
+```
+
+Warning : Although this is easier for IDE debugging setups, once you do this,
+you cannot change configurations on the mvn command line, such as testing without s3guard.
