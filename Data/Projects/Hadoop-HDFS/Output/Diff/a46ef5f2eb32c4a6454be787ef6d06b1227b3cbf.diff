 new Access Point ARN. So, for example `s3a://sample-bucket/key` will now use your
 configured ARN when getting data from S3 instead of your bucket.
 
-You can also use an Access Point name as a path URI such as `s3a://finance-team-access/key`, by
-configuring the `.accesspoint.arn` property as a per-bucket override:

 The `fs.s3a.accesspoint.required` property can also require all access to S3 to go through Access
 Points. This has the advantage of increasing security inside a VPN / VPC as you only allow access
 to known sources of data defined through Access Points. In case there is a need to access a bucket
 directly (without Access Points) then you can use per bucket overrides to disable this setting on a
-bucket by bucket basis i.e. `fs.s3a.{YOUR-BUCKET}.accesspoint.required`.
