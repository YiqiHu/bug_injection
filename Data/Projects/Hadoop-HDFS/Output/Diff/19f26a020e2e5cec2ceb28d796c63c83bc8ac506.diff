 copyFromLocal
 -------------
 
-Usage: `hadoop fs -copyFromLocal <localsrc> URI`

-Similar to the `fs -put` command, except that the source is restricted to a local file reference.

-(assuming the permissions can be propagated across filesystems)
-* `-f` : Overwrites the destination if it already exists.
-* `-l` : Allow DataNode to lazily persist the file to disk, Forces a replication
- factor of 1. This flag will result in reduced durability. Use with care.
-* `-d` : Skip creation of temporary file with the suffix `._COPYING_`.
+Identical to the -put command.
