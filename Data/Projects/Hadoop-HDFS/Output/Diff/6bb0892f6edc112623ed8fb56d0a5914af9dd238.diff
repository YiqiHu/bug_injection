 | Property | Description |
 |:---- |:---- |
 | `yarn.scheduler.fair.allocation.file` | Path to allocation file. An allocation file is an XML manifest describing queues and their properties, in addition to certain policy defaults. This file must be in the XML format described in the next section. If a relative path is given, the file is searched for on the classpath (which typically includes the Hadoop conf directory). Defaults to fair-scheduler.xml. |
-| `yarn.scheduler.fair.user-as-default-queue` | Whether to use the username associated with the allocation as the default queue name, in the event that a queue name is not specified. If this is set to "false" or unset, all jobs have a shared default queue, named "default". Defaults to true. If a queue placement policy is given in the allocations file, this property is ignored. |

If this is set to "false" or unset, all jobs have a shared default queue, named "default". Defaults to true. If a queue placement policy is given in the allocations file, this property is ignored. **Note:** If this is set to false, the "default" queue needs to be declared in the allocations file. |
 | `yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption` | Whether to use preemption. Defaults to false. |
 | `yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption.cluster-utilization-threshold` | The utilization threshold after which preemption kicks in. The utilization is computed as the maximum ratio of usage to capacity among all resources. Defaults to 0.8f. |
 | `yarn.scheduler.fair.sizebasedweight` | Whether to assign shares to individual apps based on their size, rather than providing an equal share to all apps regardless of size. When set to true, apps are weighted by the natural logarithm of one plus the app's total requested memory, divided by the natural logarithm of 2. Defaults to false. |

 | `yarn.scheduler.fair.max.assign` | If assignmultiple is true and dynamic.max.assign is false, the maximum amount of containers that can be assigned in one heartbeat. Defaults to -1, which sets no limit. |
 | `yarn.scheduler.fair.locality.threshold.node` | For applications that request containers on particular nodes, the number of scheduling opportunities since the last container assignment to wait before accepting a placement on another node. Expressed as a float between 0 and 1, which, as a fraction of the cluster size, is the number of scheduling opportunities to pass up. The default value of -1.0 means don't pass up any scheduling opportunities. |
 | `yarn.scheduler.fair.locality.threshold.rack` | For applications that request containers on particular racks, the number of scheduling opportunities since the last container assignment to wait before accepting a placement on another rack. Expressed as a float between 0 and 1, which, as a fraction of the cluster size, is the number of scheduling opportunities to pass up. The default value of -1.0 means don't pass up any scheduling opportunities. |
-| `yarn.scheduler.fair.allow-undeclared-pools` | If this is true, new queues can be created at application submission time, whether because they are specified as the application's queue by the submitter or because they are placed there by the user-as-default-queue property. If this is false, any time an app would be placed in a queue that is not specified in the allocations file, it is placed in the "default" queue instead. Defaults to true. If a queue placement policy is given in the allocations file, this property is ignored. |

 | `yarn.scheduler.fair.update-interval-ms` | The interval at which to lock the scheduler and recalculate fair shares, recalculate demand, and check whether anything is due for preemption. Defaults to 500 ms. |
 | `yarn.resource-types.memory-mb.increment-allocation` | The fairscheduler grants memory in increments of this value. If you submit a task with resource request that is not a multiple of `memory-mb.increment-allocation`, the request will be rounded up to the nearest increment. Defaults to 1024 MB. |
 | `yarn.resource-types.vcores.increment-allocation` | The fairscheduler grants vcores in increments of this value. If you submit a task with resource request that is not a multiple of `vcores.increment-allocation`, the request will be rounded up to the nearest increment. Defaults to 1. |
