+### <a name="auth_named_profile"></a> Using Named Profile Credentials with `ProfileCredentialsProvider`
+
+You can configure Hadoop to authenticate to AWS using a [named profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html).
+
+To authenticate with a named profile:
+
+1. Declare `com.amazonaws.auth.profile.ProfileCredentialsProvider` as the provider.
+1. Set your profile via the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable.
+1. Due to a [bug in version 1 of the AWS Java SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/803),
+you'll need to remove the `profile` prefix from the AWS configuration section heading.
+
+    Here's an example of what your AWS configuration files should look like:
+
+    ```
+    $ cat ~/.aws/config
+    [user1]
+    region = us-east-1
+    $ cat ~/.aws/credentials
+    [user1]
+    aws_access_key_id = ...
+    aws_secret_access_key = ...
+    aws_session_token = ...
+    aws_security_token = ...
+    ```
